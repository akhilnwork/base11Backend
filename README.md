## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**: `composer install && npm install`
2. **Set up database**: Configure `.env` and run `php artisan migrate`
3. **Seed admin users**: `php artisan db:seed`
4. **Generate app key**: `php artisan key:generate`
5. **Link storage**: `php artisan storage:link`
6. **Set up queue worker**: `php artisan queue:work` (for production)
7. **Configure mail settings** in `.env`

## 📱 Frontend Integration

The API is designed to work seamlessly with Next.js. Example usage:

```javascript
// Fetch blogs
const response = await fetch('http://your-api.com/api/v1/blogs');
const blogs = await response.json();

// Submit contact form
const response = await fetch('http://your-api.com/api/v1/contact', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(formData)
});
```

The foundation is solid and ready for frontend integration. The admin interface and media management system are the next priority items to complete the full CMS functionality.
